# d2mr-unique-objectives-1-to-5-repo
This repo is to demonstrate that I can meet the github &amp; rstudio objectives.

This project uses an R-built-in dataset (i.e., mtcars) to demonstrate the github & rstudio skills (i.e., objectives 1-5) for the D2MR course.

This project aims to replicate the six plots in the "plots" folder following the instructions within the "data visualization.qmd" file.

The project sources a function that displayed in "Class_output.R" to be used in Chunk 12, when the author tried to output five classes using the "else if" function, though ultimately it didn't work.

The project also has three folders: 2 "data-visualization_files" folders and "_extensions" folder that respectively include the graphs I created and apaquarto extensions.

The "my plots" folder is in the same directory because the author wanted to test the function ggsave(). The .qmd is exported both as html and pdf.

The local_only folder contains the ggplot cheatsheet in gitignore, that doesn't belong online.
